# What we value
Many of our applicants have MSc or PhDs in math, physics, EE or computer science and many of our existing teammates graduated from the best universities worldwide. Some of us are great software engineers and others eat NeurIPS papers for
breakfast.

But we purposefully did not create one of those standard lists of minimum or preferred qualifications, because we care much more about your motivation and ability to help us accelerate the adoption of deep learning in Europe than we care
just about your CV. If any of the above challenges get your juices flowing, just like they do for us, please apply!

If you are just as excited as us about making AI easily usable and widely used, but donâ€™t have too much experience in the field yet => you can also apply for one of our internships.
