# Careers @ Luminovo

Want to help us make AI easily usable and widely used? Become a Luminerd today.

## About us
At Luminovo, our mission is to make AI easily usable and widely used. We currently focus on B2B deep learning projects and building tooling to automate common deep learning workflows.

Our team is diverse, international and fun and is made up of graduates from Stanford University, ETH Zurich, TUM and CDTM. After stints at Google, Intel and McKinsey, our two founders met at Stanford University and decided to relocate to
Munich in 2017 to help European businesses accelerate the adoption of deep learning.

We love to work with exceptional people on interesting problems. So far, our clients include startups from Silicon Valley, mid-sized German companies, as well as established DAX corporations.

## What we value
Many of our applicants have MSc or PhDs in math, physics, EE or computer science and many of our existing teammates graduated from the best universities worldwide. Some of us are great software engineers and others eat NeurIPS papers for
breakfast.

But we purposefully did not create one of those standard lists of minimum or preferred qualifications, because we care much more about your motivation and ability to help us accelerate the adoption of deep learning in Europe than we care
just about your CV. If any of the challenges in the role descriptions get your juices flowing, just like they do for us, please apply!

If you are just as excited as us about making AI easily usable and widely used, but donâ€™t have too much experience in the field yet: you can also apply for one of our internships.
