# Deep Learning Engineer (m/f/d)

## Your Role
If you are a deep learning native (or want to become one) this is the role for you. If you feel more like a software engineering wizard, make sure to look at our role for Software Engineers. If you can’t decide, just apply for one and we will figure things out together. After all: we are a young start-up and the challenges our engineering team faces are quite diverse, so the line between the two roles can be blurry and depends more on what you bring to the table than how we decorate it. 
Nuff said, let’s dive right in. This is some of the stuff we need your help with: 

* Take ownership of deep learning projects from beginning (understanding the problem that we’re trying to solve) to end (a deployed model)
* Demonstrate strong problem-solving skills when faced with diverse machine learning problems. This includes:	
    * Quickly grasping the business context of the problem at hand and using your knowledge of how the model is going to be used to choose the right evaluation metric
    * Digging deep into the data and the underlying data sources to choose the right dataset split and to identify pitfalls arising from non-iid samples 
* Combining both your practical and theoretical ML knowledge to set the right priorities when choosing which idea or approach to try next						
* Implement and tune state-of-the-art ML models (our focus is on computer vision and NLP algorithms) to get the best results given the available data							
* Support the project proposal phase for new clients. This includes:
    * Translating business problems to technical solutions and figuring out if ML is the best way to go
    * Doing literature research to stay up-to-date about state-of-the-art methods and coming up with your own ideas to identify the best machine learning approach for the problem at hand
* Effectively communicate and document your approach, progress, results and challenges both within the team and towards our clients
* Show that you’re continuously striving to learn and push yourself (and our team) by surfacing great ideas and finding ways to improve the tools and processes we use
* Participate in our team’s bi-weekly insight hour. A paper reading group with the occasional software engineering topic added into the mix.
* Join in on our epic team events. We just recently showed off our skills playing Laser Tag, delivered a very average performance at one of the local pub quizzes and are planning to take another overnight trip to the Alps! Otherwise, take part in our spontaneous office beer time and get treated to lunch by Luminovo once a week.
