# Software Engineer (m/f/d)

## Your Role
If you are a software engineering wizard (or want to become one) this is the role for you. If you feel more like a deep-learning native make sure to look at our role for Deep Learning Engineers. If you can’t decide, just apply for one and we will figure things out together. After all: we are a young start-up and the challenges our engineering team faces are quite diverse, so the line between the two roles can be blurry and depends more on what you bring to the table than how we decorate it. 
Nuff said, let’s dive right in. This is some of the stuff we need your help with: 

* Contribute to our internal tooling for dataset versioning, automated hyperparameter tuning, experiment tracking and visualisation and model deployment. This includes:
    * Building evolutionary architecture for our internal libraries and services
    * Designing and implementing APIs and the corresponding backend for our services
    * Ensuring our code base stays easy to understand and easy to change				
* Set-up performant data ingestion pipelines to load and preprocess data from various sources		
* Improve our DevOps practices including continuous integration, deployment pipelines and Infrastructure-as-Code (to manage our cloud computing services)	
* Effectively communicate and document your approach, progress, results and challenges both within the team and towards our clients
* Show that you’re continuously striving to learn and push yourself (and our team) by surfacing great ideas and finding ways to improve the tools and processes we use
* Participate in our team’s bi-weekly insight hour. A paper reading group with the occasional software engineering topic added into the mix.
* Join in on our epic team events. We just recently showed off our skills playing Laser Tag, delivered a very average performance at one of the local pub quizzes and are planning to take another overnight trip to the Alps! Otherwise, take
 part in our spontaneous office beer time and get treated to lunch by Luminovo once a week.
