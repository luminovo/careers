# Deep Learning Engineer Intern (m/f/d)

## Your role
Please have a look at our [Deep Learning Engineer (Full-Time)](deep-learning-engineer.md) position. As an intern at Luminovo you are immediately part of the core team and you will be doing much of the same things as our full-time employees depending on your experience and skill level when you start your internship.

## Your internship
Here are some more fun facts about your internship at Luminovo:

* We do regular 1:1s, retrospectives and paper reading groups to make sure we are constantly getting better at what we do.
* On the same note: we value psychological safety and honest feedback a lot! As an intern, as much as a full-time employee, we expect you to speak up and share your ideas about what we can improve within the company.
* We do regular company events together (just recently we went to Oktoberfest together, delivered a very average performance at one of the local pub quizzes, and stayed overnight at a winter hut during our hiking trip to the Alps)
* We have a very active #random channel on Slack
* We just moved in our own office in the core of Munich

If you are just as excited as we are about making AI easily usable and widely used and want to work with some of the best AI engineers in Germany, please apply!
